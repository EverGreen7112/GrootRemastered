/**
 * A class for <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-roeu/products/gamepads/extreme-3d-pro-joystick.html">
 * Logitech's Extreme 3D Pro Joystick</a>, with all of its buttons as members, so there is no need to 
 * initilize or keep track of individual buttons. <p><p>
 * The Buttons are mapped as such: <p>
 * The buttons on they joystick itself are "top", and the ones on it base are "bottom".
 * The buttons on the left of the driver (with the Y axis pointoing forward) are "left", and the ones to
 * their right are "right".
 * The buttons on closer to the driver are "back" and the ones further away from them are "forward". <p><p>
 * Note that this class inherits {@link JoystickEG}, so it can be constructed with an
 * {@link Adjuster} which will automatically adjust its getRawAxis values.
